Summary: Silverstripe has come on board as a sponsor of GovHack Wellington

Silverstripe, creators of the open source CMS, have become a sponsor of GovHack. We understand they also are likely to be entering a team, so watch out for their elite team of open source hackers on the day.

Silverstripe love open source, and have been a consistent supporter of many a grass roots initiative in Wellington.
