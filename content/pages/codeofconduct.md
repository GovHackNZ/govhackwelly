Summary: GovHack Wellington is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.

GovHack Wellington is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. 

We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any part of the hackathon venue, including talks.

Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the hackathon organizers. 

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon. 

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the hackathon staff immediately.** 

Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. 

We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues and hackathon-related social events.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment:
